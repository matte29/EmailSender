# EmailSender

An application that can be used to send emails to many recipients in a short amount of time.

## What you need

- An HTML file for the body of the email

- A CSV file for the list of recipients (email addresses)



## Future features

I don't know how to word this so here is an example.

In the body of the HTML file you can have a {Name} value that can be filled with values from the CSV file.

It will take the value from the CSV file and use it to fill that value in HTML that is shown in the email.
